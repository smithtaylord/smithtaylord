### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently working on completing my studies as a Full Stack Software Development Student at Boise Code Works. I'm excited to apply these skills in a software development role and contribute to the success of a team.

- 💬 Ask me about my experience in management and leadership, and how it has helped me become a more effective software developer. I'm also happy to talk about my favorite development tools and techniques.

- 📫 You can reach me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylor-smith-3b63405a/  or via email at Smith.TaylorD@gmail.com. I'm always happy to connect with other professionals in the industry and discuss potential collaboration opportunities.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

- ⚡ Fun fact: In a previous role, I worked closely with a software development team to create and implement a warehouse management system, which sparked my interest in pursuing a career in software development. I also love to hike and explore the great outdoors in my free time.
